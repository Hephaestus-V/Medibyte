Medibyte 

*Unlock your health potential with Medibyte - where health meets innovation, revolutionise your well-being with Medibyte services* ðŸ©º


Medibyte is a project that leverages the power of the Avalanche smart contract platform to reward users with onchain tokens that link to a unique dynamic NFT. The project attempts to promote healthy living choices by rewarding users with Medicoin tokens (transferrable to USDC tokens) according to data held offchain health-related data. 

The project is accessible to users across the globe and ensures a data intensive process like searching and maintaining health records, a very easy task with its friendly user interface. You can see it live here: https://

**Motivation behind the project**

Medibyte was created to solve the issue of costs associated with medical facilities and the resulting temptation for people to succumb to unhealthy options because they are cheaper. We saw an opportunity to tokenise health statistics via a dynamic NFTs that also serve the purpose of handing back the ownership of medical records back to users. Our mission is to reward healthy alternatives and avoid healthcare congestion as a result of avoidable habits leading to adverse health conditions (think obesity, high blood pressure, smoking-related cancers). 

Coming from a variety of backgrounds and healthcare systems, the Medibyte Team decided on this project given the ability for health to transcend geographical boundaries and create a sense of community towards a common goal. As a globalised society, we also recognise that healthier options sometimes aren't as accessible as they should be (e.g. in some countries, soft drink is cheaper than water in stores). Our aim is to create a transparent reward system that brings the cost of healthier options, parallel to the cheaper unhealthy options.  


**How it works**

The project fetches up-to-date health records from an external API, constructs a dynamic NFT personalised to each individual based on their uploaded health records, and gives tokens to users able to evidence better medical testing relative to the last onchain record. Should a user wish to exchange USDC for Medicoin they are able to do so, making Medicoin a readily tradeable and dynamic token. 

**Backend**

Found here: https://github.com/TeamMaverick5/Medibyte/tree/main/ipfs-api

The backend infrastructure is built with MongoDB and Node.js, noting that data is decentralised via the IPFS gateway. 


**Frontend**

Found here: https://github.com/TeamMaverick5/Medibyte/tree/main/client

The frontend uses React and  Vite to provide a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. Together, these tools provide users with a minimalist and modern interface for frictionless interaction with the backend.

**Summary**

When using Medibyte, health records are stored via offchain services and subsequently decentralised via the IPFS gateway to ensure the data is both immutable and secure. This evidences the ability for health records to be truly owned and easily accessed by individuals to yield a net positive to society. This project also demonstrates the potential to reward users via tokens linked to real world outcomes. Changing and storing medical data is very easy, provided health professionals will enter the data on a client's behalf and it is displayed in real time to the client. This means all the user has to do is log on, look at the records and focus on building a healthier lifestyle. Our features tab has a limited list of services you can see for yourself. 


**Challenges we ran into**

Aside from the conceptual design of the project, we also ran into the logistical issue of communicating from different time difference. Another challenge was the actual encryption of user data. Initially we had a centralised database that we were unsure how to integrate into the Web3 space but ultimately resolved this by looking to the IPFS gateway. 

**Accomplishments**

We are proud of finishing the project on time which seemed almost unlikely due to some bugs we ran into across our journey. 

But overall, we are incredibly proud of Medibyte due to its potential to bring efficiencies into the healthcare industry. The collaborative effort, overcoming technical challenges, and delivering a functional product within a limited time frame showcased our team's dedication, technical skills, and creativity. This accomplishment not only reflects our budding passion but also our commitment to creating impactful technology, especially at our level of experience in using Web3 technology.

**What we learnt**

At a minimum, we enhanced our ability to ask intelligent questions to the Chainlink dev team and utilised Stackoverflow when running into technical issues during the hackathon.
