# Medibyte

Medibyte is a cutting edge health-focused initiative that leverages the power of blockchain technology to reward users for healthy living! 

**About Us**

The Medibyte Team understands some companies increase costs as a result of unhealthy lifestyle choices. What about those that choose to live healthier and look after themselves? Enter Medibyte. This initiative is aimed at those living the healthier lifestyle and wanting a reward to keep up the good work. We understand that the soy latte might be more expensive than a hot chocolate, so we want to take the byte out of healthy living.

**Features**

This system differs from typical cashback schemes that see you wait days or even weeks for cashback on services rendered. Instead, you receive Medicoins based on your own choices and they are made readily available to you after your doctor has inputted your results. The amount of coins you receive is contingent on you improving your 'health score' from your previous check-up. See the example below for greater insights. 

A feature that is greatly overlooked is that this scheme is totally free! Unlike centralised corporations, our intention is only to guide you towards our platform and promote healthier living. 

This platform is also encrypted and tested using modern software tools. In the same vein as protecting your data, the  Medibyte team also ensures that they will not sell your data.


*Example*

Harry goes for a general check up at his local health professional. During the appointment he gets a blood pressure test. His doctor enters the results onto the Medibyte platform. The Medibyte platform takes this measurement and benchmarks it to your results the last time you visited a health professional. After your appointment, you are able to log onto the site and claim your reward, exchanging it for Medicoins and then subsequently other recognised crypto or fiat currency.

**Services**

We are updating this all the time depending on the services you care about the most. So far, we offer rewards for:
1. blood pressure tests;
2. flu vaccinations; 
3.
4.
5.
6.


**New Account**

The process is a walk in the park:

1. Register your account on the landing page; 
2. Tell your doctor or hospital that you use Medibyte; and 
3. Sit back while your data works for you!

By harnessing the power of blockchain, your medical records are stored in a secure and unchanging database that acts as a reference point for health professionals and services. 

By investing in yourself, we believe you should be rewarded for it! If you show an improvement (not matter how big or small) between appointments with a recognised health professional, Medibyte will grant a token that may be exchange for your local currency.
